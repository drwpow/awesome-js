# 📒 Awesome JS

People sometimes ask me “what’s a good library for \_\_\_\_\_\_?” and I’ll have to go back through bookmarks and newsletters to find a link. This is a list for me to keep track of projects I like, as well as make recommendations easier for others. This is a list of my preferences which you may or may not agree with. Roughly, my criteria are:

1. **Simplicity:** Is this clear in purpose or is it pulled in too many directions?
1. **Performance:** Is this an independent library, or does it have a lot of heavy dependencies?
1. **Innovation:** Is this a fresh, new perspective in a way that’s helpful?
